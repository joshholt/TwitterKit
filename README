*****************************************************************************

WARNING:

	This was just ripped out of http://sc-twitapp.appspot.com and turned into
	a framework and heavily modified.
	
	The usage of SC.UserDefaults in this framework is really wonky at the 
	moment... I'm not quite sure why, but that's b/c it's a bit late to
	figure out.
	
	If you see the error, let me know or fork away!!

---------------------TwitterKit----------------------------------------------

What is TwitterKit?

	TwitterKit is a library intended to be included in the frameworks
	directory of a SproutCore application.
	
Plans:

	TwitterKit will support Twitter's full and search APIs. Currently
	only the search API is supported. I plan to support the full Twitter API
	in the near future.
	
Usage:

	1.) Include the TwitterKit framework as a prerequisite in your Buildfile.
	2.) Use the TwitterKit controllers
	4.) Go Twitter Crazy...

More Documentation on the way...
